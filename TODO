# Image handling
[X] Add basic collage (2 and 4 images in a grid only)
    [ ] Add a page with a save button
    [ ] Make images close to each other (remove margins)
[ ] USE GROUPBOX IN IMAGE EDIT MENU to avoid logic
[\] REFACTOR GALLERY PAGE & MAIN PAGE
    [\] Add text search mechanism to MAIN PAGE
    [\] Add create button / open folder to MAIN PAGE
    [\] Add radio button + camera model + camera serial to MAIN PAGE
    [\] Remove text search from GALLERY PAGE
    [ ] NO MORE NEED FOR GALLERY PAGE, only GALLERY WIDGET. WRONG

[ ] CAMERA ISSUES
    [ ] Support 2 different cameras connections
    [ ] SD CARD is replaced or inserted...


[ ] Focus by default on the search bar to show user he should be writing
[\] Reduce time in load images (seperate process to remove background)
    [\] Reduce background removal process wait by running it in the background.
        [ ] Run it asynchronously
    [ ] Reduce gallery loading time (Show loading screen or update incrementaly?)
[\] Add undo/redo
    [X] Undo
    [ ] Redo
[ ] Add red/green circle for camera detected with 2 labels
    [\] red/green circle
        [ ] Modify its location in the window
    [X] modelStr
    [X] serialNumber
[ ] remove_background uses original picture and not current_pixmap (Should be handled by seperate thread)
[ ] Improve drawing frequency (since there's a small lag on images)
[ ] Improve text with QTextEdit
[ ] CROP (??)
[ ] Transition between all images (viewImage page maybe)

# Camera
[ ] Get Camera type and serial number and show them in the GUI
[ ] What happens if camera's wifi disconnects every time? Should we poll or hold the connection back?
[ ] Do we need to support camera API instead of thread?

# Application
[\] Handle basic exceptions (Folder not found, any other exception)
    [ ] Folder shouldn't be loaded
[\] Create packaging branch in which I created github jobs to package for windows/mac/linux
[ ] Use logger instead of prints...
/!\ BUGS
[ ] Start-up/close too slow
[ ] Weird image handling issues sometimes (bmp and png file formats)

# DNN
[ ] Cephalometric data check
[ ] Train U-Net for detecting cephalometric landmarks
